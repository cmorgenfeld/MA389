            MA389 is a course intended for individually supervised research and study, in order to 
            familiarize cadets with techniques used in advanced scientific study. The primary purpose is 
            to prepare students for independent research in mathematics with the essential skills required. 
            With the approval of the Head of the Department, the cadet chooses a research project of interest
            and is supervised by a faculty member conducting the research.

        <p><span class="title-div">Modelling approaches.</span></p>
        
        <p><div class="text-block">
            Statistical models draw conclusions from real-world data. Researchers exploring a question may design 
            an experiment or utilize existing sources to collect their data. They can then use a wide array statistical
            methods to evaluate the data and arrive at a solution. Statistical models gain credibility from their
            direct link to real-world data, although the model's descriptive ability is limited by the quality of 
            the data or study.
        </div></p>

        <p><div class="text-block">
            Mechanistic models ground potential solutions in the ``mechanics'' of real-world phenomenon. Mathematicians 
            may look to biology, engineering, physics, or other fields to understand the processes and laws governing 
            certain processes. While a statistical approach may struggle to provide data providing both internal and 
            external validity to a model, a mechanistic approach instead works to determine the solve a general form of 
            the problem before adjusting the values of constants to match real-world occurrences. The resulting model is 
            more flexible and generalizable than a statistical model, although it may sacrifice complexity for mathematical elegance.
        </div></p>

        <p><div class="text-block">
            While both modelling approaches suffer from unique challenges, a combination of the techniques can yield 
            powerful and insightful results. A mechanistic approach lends to a model both a firm grounding in the 
            laws that govern reality, as well as ``future proofing'' the work by maintaining a generalizability 
            untethered to imperfect data. A statistical approach allows for an informed estimates of constants 
            and links past measurements to future predictions.

        <p><span class="title-div">Why running?</span></p>
        
        <p><div class="text-block">
            Long distance running is a popular sport, as evidenced by a huge number of participants in marathons worldwide (50,000 in 
            the NYC marathon alone). And while there exists accurate predictors of aerobic performance, these are physiological factors
            like VO2 max and lactate threshold. These factors require expensive, time consuming, difficult tests to accurately estimate. 
            Training indices, on the other hand, are already tracked by nearly all runners. These include distance, time, pace, and heart rate.
            Building a mathematical model to predict long distance race performance using training indices, rather than physiological factors,
            will improve amateur runners' ability to set informed performance goals.  
        </div></p>

        <p><div class="text-block">
            In short, there exists a lack of predictive tools grounded in mechanistic math modelling for the amateur runner.
